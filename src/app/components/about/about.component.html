          <p class="lead mb-4"> Since 2018 , I aspired to be an entrepreneur but struggled to begin due to my middle-class background. My father’s retail work and mother’s homemaking shaped my perspective, yet uncertainty impacted my health, worsening PCOD. Heeding my mother’s advice, I prioritized wellness—through coaching, nutrition, and community support—I reversed my condition, losing 10 kg in three months. During the pandemic, I joined a wellness community, guiding others battling health issues, which revealed the transformative power of lifestyle changes. This experience, coupled with interactions with homemakers, showed me the potential of women leading change. </p>
          <p class="mb-4">This inspired  <b> <i>“Live Your Best Life,”</i></b> a platform to empower individuals, especially homemakers and youth, with trusted wellness support. Our mission is rooted in personal triumph and proven community impact—ensuring you’ll never regret joining this journey.  </p>
